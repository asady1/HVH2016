Run Alphabet with command: 

python -i 2p1Alphabet_backsig.py --Selection="dijet_mass < 135 && dijet_mass > 105 && csv1 > 0.8484 && csv2 > 0.8484"

for example. Still missing correct way to create card for combine - need to account for floating normalization of ttbar, and perhaps a couple other systematics or statistical errors.
