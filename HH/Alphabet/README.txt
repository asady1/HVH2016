For Alphabet to work you will need the usual header files:
- Alphabet_Header.py
- Plotting_Header..py
- Converters.py
- Distribution_Header.py
- Alphabet.py

These are available in the python directory, and should be shared by all channels: HH, VH, 2p1, etc...
Also, you need to create folders: outputs and outputs/datacards wherever you want to run Alphabet, or it will crash.

Make sure you have the paths to the datasets and signals correct. At the moment I have them hard coded to my running directory, but this will likely need an update.
