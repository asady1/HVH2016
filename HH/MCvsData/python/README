VHbb Analysis
Philipp Eller, 01.10.2012


EXPLANATION:
___________

The Analysis is split up in several steps. Having the step2 Ntupels the code does the following:

- prepare the environement (skim trees, write sample.info): This uses the info about your MC samples and data stored in *samples*.cfg and creates a new subdirectory 'env/'
- write systematics and the regression: This creates a new subdirectory 'sys/'
(optional: - do a new training)
- apply all MVAs to the trees. this creates the subdirectory 'MVAout/'
- write the RooFit Workspaces and the DataCards


EXAMPLE OF STEPS TO RUN:
_______________________
*** the analysis is designed to be run on the T3 cluster, you can run locally by not using the 'submitThem.py' script
*** make sure you understand the config*TeV, where everything can be set for the Analysis. If something needs to be changed it should be done via this config, NOT by changing the code!

- Edit pathConfig*TeV and make sure the directories for plots and Limits exist, point the right path to the code and your directory where you have the trees)
- Edit *samples*.cfg according to your MC samples and Data
(if you need to change something later there is an updater script updateinfo.py) 

- run ./submitThem.py -T 8TeV -J prep

check with ./showinfo.py PATH/env/ that everything is correct

- run ./submitThem.py -T 8TeV -J sys
- run ./submitThem.py -T 8TeV -J eval

(if you want to test or run individual samples, add the option -S SAMPLE, e.g. '-S ZH125')

make some plots (at the latest here) with
- run ./submitThem.py -T 8TeV -J plot -M 125 (makes plot with ZH125 as Signal)

make the datacards:
-run ./submitThem.py -T 8TeV -J dc -M 125 (or -M all for all Masses)

you should now have DC, TH and WS files for every Mass and Region in the Limit Directory.

From there, using CMSSW:

to combine channels
- combineCards.py vhbb_DC_*1.txt vhbb_DC_2*.txt ... >> vhbb_combinedDC.txt

then calculate the Limit, for example Asymptotic
- combine -M Asymptotic vhbb_combinedDC.txt

or with Toys the option -t # (# number of toys)
